# AVPSO-MUD
This is my effort to build a MUD in Ruby for fun.

WARNING!
This Ruby program requires an API connection to Google for data storage.

I followed this guide in how to set it up.

Also this will help:
https://rubygems.org/gems/google_drive/versions/2.1.5

I will not be uploading the Json to GitHub for obvious security reasons so you will have to make one for this script to work.
