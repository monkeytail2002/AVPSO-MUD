The Lake House
~
This week, we are playing a MUD.  Multi User Dungeon for those that don't know.  Now that you've chosen your race
and class, now it's time to train.  You can train until you're 5th level here, or you can bugger off without training.
To the North you can see a black swirling portal set in a bronze picture frame.  The rest of the room is nothing
special, in fact it could do with some cleaning.  Scrawled on the wall is some sort of graffiti which you can barely
make out.

An ominous swirling black portal gives off a faint feeling of dread.  It feels like it's looking back at you.  You can
hear a faint giggle coming from it.

The Hallway
~
After an unknown length of time, you finally exit out of the portal and arrive in a hallway.  The walls are varnished
pine and there are what look like finger scratches along the floor.  As if someone had been dragged against their will.
  There is a faint smell of vaseline in the air and that ominous feeling of dread has increased.  The hall stretches on
to the north and there is a door to the south.

The hallway is dim and you think you can see shapes up ahead.  It appears to be the only way forward.
